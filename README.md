# CryptoClustering
Carolyn Scheese
Module 11 - AI Bootcamp
Due: August 21, 2024

##Description 
In this Challenge, I learned to apply my understanding of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. Specifically, I examined price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year. 

The tutors were particularly helpful in explaining concepts of K values and understanding the Elbow curve. 

##Applications used: 
I initially used Jupyter Lab to create this assignment. After the first few sections, I restarted the assignment in Google Colab because of it's embedded and well developed GenAI coding tool. One of the Tutor's taught me how to use this tool even better and smarter. I completed the assignment in Colab. 

##Assistance: I received assistance from 2 different tutors on this assignment. I also used X-pert Learning, ChapGPT and of course, Google Colab. I also referred back to "solved" key assignments that we worked on in class.
